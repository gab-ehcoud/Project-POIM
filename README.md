Problem We are focusing on-
--In developing countries like INDIA, Low Tension (LT) power distribution systems is not effective in terms of power outages . Thus leaving millions of customers with little or no options when their power outage happens.
--Currently, consumers have to call up the Control Room to report a supply outage, for the agents to react and mobilize fixing team for repair. If sufficient consumers choose to report a power outage within quick succession, it may prompt the Agent to think that power outage happened, or fuse blown and consequently it directs the
fixing team accordingly.
--However, if this consumer response is not forthcoming, the field crew has to carry out trial and error inspections to locate the damaged transformer or junction box, resulting in a considerable delay in repair.
--Furthermore, a delay in knowing that an outage has occurred, from consumer phone calls, delays the overall restoration time.

# In a simple words, if we define our problem- On low tension transmission,
# The manual procedure of power outage info is outdated and time-taking.
# Also monitoring of transformers’ health in real time is still a challenge.



# Solution

# POIM (POWER OUTAGE INFO MODULE) 
A Power Outage Info module has been invented, designed and developed, which senses electricity supply outages at strategic "nodes" of the Low-tension distribution network. It relays the information back to the Control Room within seconds of occurrence for the Management to take necessary corrective/preventive measures. Not only does the module match the technical requisites, but also, is economic enough to meet the shoe-string budgets of the ailing utilities.

# Installation of Database
First create the database on you server, download the sql file and upload cum import on your database. Now change the required credentails in connect.php.
